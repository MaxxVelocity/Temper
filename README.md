# Temper
A domain-specific language for creating finite state machines with automatic transition.

This project was created out of sheer boredom, working for a certain retail corporation that wasn't making use of my skills. 

I had the idea that it would be nice if there were a simple language that could be used to define and traverse a map of finite states in an agnostic fasion. 

The result is a syntax that lends itself to simplified cases of automata, as any transition can be invoked with any sort of delegated logic. 

There may be very little real-world application for this, but I leave it here as a way to demonstrate how easy and effective it is to apply a DSL and agnostic architecture to a concept.
